            <p>
                Team Schnaps is more than just a community, we are enthusiasts, and friends united by our passion for
                bouldering. Founded back in 2020 and located in Berlin.
                We believe that bouldering is for everyone. Our diverse and inclusive team has members of various
                backgrounds, ages, and abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Team Schnaps is not just about climbing, but about having fun and having a good time.
                Beyond the gym walls, we foster a sense of community that extends into everyday life.
                We often make gatherings to communicate and share experiences, with a glass of a tipsy drink.
